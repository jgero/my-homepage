<h1>who am i?</h1>

<p>I am a passionate software developer born in 1998 in Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, Germany. While studying
for my Bachelors degree in Aalen from 2016 to 2020, programming became not only my future
profession, but also a beloved free-time activity. Right after finishing my Bachelors degree I
started my Masters degree in 2020.  Web development has been my main focus, most of my bigger
projects are showcased on this website.  </p>
