		<p>
			I am a software developer born in 1998 in Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, Germany.
			While studying for my Bachelors degree in Aalen from 2016 to 2020,
			programming became not only my future profession, but also a beloved
			free-time activity. Right after finishing my Bachelors degree I started my
			Masters degree in 2020. Web development has been my main focus, most of my
			bigger projects are showcased on this website.

			Sport is a very important part of my life. I have been doing acrobatics
			for 13 years at a local club, at which I am a coach for multiple groups as
			well. Additionally to the organized sport, I am inline skating and running
			outside, so I am active more or less every day.

			Space, astronomy, space probes and space travel are a fascinating science.
			Seeing the wonders of our universe and how they are discovered inspires
			and motivates me to be productive every day.

		<p>
			Because I spend a lot of time working on Web Applications a big chunck of
			my skills are in the JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML and CSS ecosystem. This
			also includes a bit of SVG for data visualization.
		</p>
		<p>
			In my jobs as working student I was working with Java most of the time.
			This included developing tools to improve the testability of the system,
			as well as working on the actual backend Java codebase.
		</p>
		<p>
			There are many more languages I know. To stay up to date with the
			developments in the computer science world I experiment a lot with other
			languages. Together with the languages I have and had contact with through
			university lectures the list gets extended by Go, C, C++, Python and Dart.

			Depending on the job that has to be done I work with a range of different
			frameworks. These span from frontend JavaScript frameworks like Angular
			and Svelte to frameworks for creating APIs (Express.js) and data
			persistence (Hibernate). I also worked with Flutter to create multiple
			mobile Apps for university courses.

			Cloud computing is growing daily to become an even bigger topic in every
			aspect of server infrastructure. This means at the same time, that
			containerization is a vital skill to be able to smoothly deploy
			applications to production.
		</p>
		<p>
			I really like containers for building modular development environments as
			well. To save myself from the need to setup all the tools with maybe
			different versions between projects on my workstation I often containerize
			them.
		</p>
		<p>
			By using containers for development and production setups I have gathered
			quite some knowledge about container engines like Podman and Docker.
			Orchestrating these containers with Kubernetes is also something I have
			done. Ansible is another tool I am actively using for some of my personal
			projects to setup and deploy services.

		<h2><span class="material-icons">storage</span></h2>
		<p>
			Regarding database systems I worked the most with document databases,
			especially Firestore and MongoDB. In lectures about current and future
			database paradigms I learned about Graph-, Document-, Time Series- and
			Wide Column-Databases. By knowing the strengths and weaknesses of these
			systems, being able to model data to fit into a systems is a skill that
			comes naturally.
		</p>
		<p>
			Of course relational database systems and SQL are also subjects in
			university. I learned to calculate the normal forms, designing table
			structures and SQL. Until now I only worked infrequently with such systems
			in my job as working student and in my personal projects.
